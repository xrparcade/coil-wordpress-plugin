== Installation ==

1. Install the official Coil Web Monetization plugin.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress.
3. Select 'Coil' in the Admin menu.
4. Select the 'Global Settings' tab and enter your payment pointer.
5. Click 'Save Changes'.

== Features ==

Our plugin lets you add monetization to all or some of your pages and posts.

* Monetized and Public (default) - Allow all visitors to see the content, get paid when your visitor is a Coil Member
* Coil Members Only - Only allow Coil Members to see the content
* No Monetization - Allow all visitors to see the content, don't get paid when your visitor is a Coil Member

The plugin is supported with the Classic and Block/Gutenberg editors. Monetization can be assigned globally to pages and posts, to individual pages and posts, and to tags and categories. If you're using the Gutenberg editor, you can choose to monetize at the block level.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I start using the Coil Web Monetization plugin? =

Simply install the plugin. Once activated, you must enter your payment pointer in the plugin's 'Global Settings' tab.

= What's an ILP-enabled digital wallet? =

The Interledger Protocol (ILP) is an open protocol that Coil uses to stream payments. A digital wallet provider must support this protocol to receive payments from us. For more information about supported digital wallets, see [Digital Wallets](https://webmonetization.org/docs/ilp-wallets).

= What's a payment pointer? =

A payment pointer is like an email address for your digital wallet. It's how we know where to stream your payments. Your payment pointer is assigned to you by your wallet provider. 

= Do I have to sign up for a Coil Membership? =

Nope. You'll receive payments from Coil Members regardless of whether you have an account with us. 

= Where can I report bugs or contribute to the project? =
